CleanWater is a comprehensive Smart Health Surveillance System designed to tackle the critical issue of waterborne diseases in communities. It provides a role-based platform for ASHA workers, doctors, citizens, and health officials to collaboratively monitor water quality and public health. This project was built by our team only for SIH Internal.
